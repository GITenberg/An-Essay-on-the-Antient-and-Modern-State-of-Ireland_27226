What gave them Rise, was my happening,
some Time since, to have fallen into
Company with two or three sprightly young
Gentlemen, then just returned from their
Continental Rambles,—who—altho' little
burthened with the Religion, Laws, Learning,
Policy, Customs, Habits, Manners, or
Languages of any, or the several Countries
they had scampered thro', affected, nevertheless,
an high Contempt for this,—their

In a Nation, where almost every
Gentleman is better acquainted, and
more conversant, with the Nature
and Circumstances of other Countries
than those of his own, the
Publication of such Hints as may somewhat
contribute to remove so odd an Inattention, and
induce those far better qualified to render a Subject
so interesting some Justice, will not, I
hope, be deemed an Impertinence; in one especially
who, by this Essay, however feeble, hath
nothing beside the Honour and Advantage of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> in View, a Kingdom whereof he is, without
Vanity, proud of being a Native.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the Story of Savages and Barbarians can
contain nothing instructive, or entertaining, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antemilesian</span></span> Inhabitants of this Land having
been mostly such, and all surviving Accounts
of them almost totally overcast with Fable, we
are therefore, in treating of the antient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotia</span></span>, or
modern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, to refer principally to three
distinguished æras, whereof the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> is, its
being peopled by an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iberian</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spanish</span></span>
Colony: The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em>, truly glorious, the Arrival of St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>, in his most salutary Mission: The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
and last, its Cession to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Second, King
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, (the first of the Royal Race of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plantagenet</span></span>) partly from a pretended Title of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adrian</span></span> the Fourth, Pope of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>; partly
from the restless and insatiable Desires of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> from the manifold Infirmities of the then reigning
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Chiefs—but above all, from the peculiarly
adverse Fate of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roderick</span></span>, the last of our
Kings.

Government, Letters, Sciences, Religion,
Manners and Customs of the antient Inhabitants
of this Country, hath put all those Matters in
so clear and happy, and, at the same Time, in so
strong a Light, by the Powers of various foreign
Testimonies, of undeniable Authenticity,
coincident with our own, that scarce any Thing
new can be offered on the same Subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may, however, in general be observed,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milesius</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spanish</span></span> Prince, so far
back as the Reign of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Solomon</span></span> (instigated by Necessity,
or induced by Ambition) with a considerable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Number of Associates and Followers,
landed from the Western Parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spain</span></span>, on the
Southern Coasts of this Island, where it is probable
they met little, or but faint Opposition,
from wild and undisciplined Inhabitants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those People, from their early Knowledge
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phœnician</span></span> Arts and Letters, imported
such Rudiments of Government and Learning,
as those primitive Times admitted; a Truth
visible from the Similarity or rather Identity of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phœnician</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotic</span></span> Alphabet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This antient Colony quietly settled here, remote
from the Storms and Revolutions of the
greater World, and secured by Situation from
its hostile Incursions, there is no Doubt but the
Cultivation of Religion, Philosophy, Politicks,
Poetry, and Musick, became the chief Objects
of popular Study and Application: The Spirit
of Ambition in succeeding Ages, with its unhappy
concomitant Train of Sedition, Faction,
and Violence, the foreign Invasions, and often
the intestine Oppressions and Calamities, to
which our neighbouring Nations were subject,
calling forth the protective or conciliating Aids
of those ancient Heroes, made them great Masters
also in the Art military.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pentarchy originally formed by those
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iberian</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Celtic Spaniards</span></span>, with a
popular Right of Election, was certainly a Kind of Government
extremely consistent with the Essence and
Genius of true Liberty, and a System derived
from the Patriarchs themselves. For when the
various Necessities of Society required a Subordination,
together with some stated Maxims to
go by, to avoid the confused and promiscuous
Intercourse in a State of Nature; then did the
People elect the most Virtuous and Wise, to lead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and conduct them in Times of War and Trouble;
to govern, inform, and protect them, in
milder and more auspicious Seasons. Then was
the Motto of the Crown, or of the chief Ensign
of Pre-eminence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Digniori detur</span></span>, and so continued
till the Degeneracy of Time, and the
baneful Growth of Avarice and Pride, with the
feverish Lust of Power, perverted it to—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rapiat
Fortior</span></span>!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, thro' a long Succession of Ages, was
the Condition, and such at length the Fate of
this Kingdom, destroyed after a longer Continuance
than any other can boast, by the Abuse
of its own Powers; a sure Argument that all
created Beings, all sublunary Institutions, however
wisely composed, in the very Essence of
their Creation, and in the very Rudiments of
their Formation, comprehend, at the same Time,
the Seeds of Dissolution: Yet it is not more remarkable
than true, that in the most boisterous
Periods of this Kingdom's antient Establishment,
the Arts and Sciences, with the fundamental
Principles of Constitution, were preserved
and cherished with inviolable Assiduity.
The Priests, Philosophers, Advocates, Annalists,

Religion, political Wisdom, Law, History, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">&amp;c.</span></span>
hereditarily in their respective Tribes, and to
educate in these different Branches the Chiefs
and Nobles of the Land, for which they were
graciously maintained in secure and splendid
Tranquillity: Those Sages attended the National
Conventions, where all publick Acts were religiously
recorded, and all Abuses of Power and
Government retrenched or reformed; nor were
they permitted, except in Case of extraordinary
Necessity, or uncommon Merit, to deviate from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their proper and primitive Spheres of Action:
Since, where an harmonious Subordination of
Rank and Order hath not been duly preserved,
even in free Estates, Liberty itself (wisely attempered,
the greatest of all social Blessings)
hath often, from Abuse and Neglect, sickened
into Licentiousness, the immediate lewd Mother
of Anarchy! In the visible Creation, the direct
Result of infinite Wisdom, the lesser Planets do
not interfere with, much less shock or oppose
the Motions and Revolutions of the greater;
they constantly keep the Distances first prescribed
them, and all move regularly to their
respective Ends. The most verdant and fragrant
Meadows may, from the too frequent Irruption
of muddy Waters, degenerate into
noxious Marshes, if some Care was not taken
to divert those impure Gushings into their proper
Channels. Hence it may be inferred, that
laying open the most honorary, as well as important
and useful Professions of Society, to the
Intrusion, or rather pyratical Invasions, of the
Scum and Dregs of the People, cannot, however
varnished over with the fictitious Colourings
of pretended Liberty, consist with true Political
Wisdom.

We now proceed to consider <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> in her
happiest and brightest View, after the Admission
and Propagation of Christianity. It is certain
there were many Christians in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, before
the Arrival of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palladius</span></span> in 431, or of St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> the Year following: St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kieran</span></span>,
St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ailbe</span></span>, St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Declan</span></span>, and St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibar</span></span>, whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ussher</span></span> calls the
Precursors, or Forerunners of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>, are
pregnant Proofs of this; they were of the Birth of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>,
from whence they travelled to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>,
in Search of Education and Learning, where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they lived some Years, were ordained, and returned
Home about the Year 402.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems that those early Preachers confined
their Labours to particular Places, in which they
had considerable Success, but fell very short of
converting the Body of the Nation: However,
they sowed the Seed which St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> came
after to water: And it is certain that St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>
was so well satisfied with the Progress they
made, in their particular Districts in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Munster</span></span>,
that this was the last Province in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> he
thought proper to visit. That there were many
Christians in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, at this Period, seems to
be confirmed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prosper</span></span>, who, in giving an
Account of the Mission of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palladius</span></span>, says, that
he was ordained by Pope <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Celestin</span></span>, and sent the
first Bishop to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scots</span></span> believing in Christ.
This Passage can mean nothing else, but that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palladius</span></span>, born in Britain, was sent to the Scots
[i.e. the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>] who had already formed Churches
under <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kieran</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ailbe</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Declan</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibar</span></span>; and so
the Bishop of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asaph</span></span> expounds it. This then
was the next Attempt that was made for the Conversion of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palladius</span></span> engaged in a
more ample and extensive Design than his Predecessors,
yet he failed in the Execution of it,
stay'd but a short Time in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, and did little
worth remembring; he converted, however, a
few, and is said to have founded three Churches;
but he had neither Courage to withstand the
Fierceness of the heathen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, nor Abilities,
for Want of the Language, proper for the
Work.

He was born in the extreme Bounds of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Britain</span></span>,
(in that Part thereof which is now comprehended
within the Limits of the modern
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>) at a Village called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banaven</span></span>,
in the Territory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tabernia</span></span>, (as he himself saith in
his Confession) in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vico Banaven Taberniæ</span></span>, &amp;c.
He tells us that he was born of a good Family.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ingennuus fui secundum Carnem.</span></span>
His Father was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calphurnius</span></span>, a Deacon, who was the Son
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Potitus</span></span>, a Priest; from whence may be
clearly inferred that the Clergy were not restrained
from Matrimony in that Age. He was
just advanced into his sixteenth Year, when he
was taken Captive, the Manner of which is thus
related by St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evin</span></span> and others: His Father,
Mother, Brother, and five Sisters, undertook a
Voyage to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aremorick Gaul</span></span>, (now called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bass
Bretagne</span></span>) to visit the Relations of his Mother <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Couchessa</span></span>.
It happened about this Time, that the
seven Sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Factmude</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">British</span></span>
Prince, were banished, and took to the Sea; that, making
an Inroad into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aremorick Gaul</span></span>, they took
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and his Sister, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lupita</span></span>, (some say <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tigrida</span></span>
also) Prisoners. They brought their Captives to the North of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, and sold <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milcho Mac Huanan</span></span>, a Prince of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dalaradia</span></span>:
Others tell the Story in a different Manner, and
with a stronger Degree of Probability. That the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span>
having deserted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Britain</span></span>, to preserve
their own Country from the barbarous Incursions
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Northern Hive</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> made
frequent Conquests, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">North Britain</span></span> especially, whence
returning victorious, in one of those Expeditions
among others brought <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> Captive. But in
this they all agree, and he himself confirms it,
that he continued Prisoner in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> six Years;
he was sold to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milcho</span></span> and his three Brothers,
which gave Occasion of his changing his Name into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cathraigh</span></span>,
or rather <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ceathir-Tigh</span></span>, because
he served four Masters; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ceathir</span></span> signifying four,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tigh</span></span> a House or Family. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milcho</span></span>
observing the Care and Diligence of his new Servant,
bought out the Shares of his Brothers, and made
him his own Property. He sent him to feed his Hogs on
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sliev-Mis</span></span>. And St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> himself
tells us his Behaviour in this Office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My constant Business was to feed the Hogs.
I was frequent in Prayer; the Love and Fear
of God more and more inflamed my Heart;
my Faith was enlarged, and my Spirit augmented,
so that I said an hundred Prayers by
Day, and almost as many by Night. I arose
before Day to my Prayers, in the Snow, in the
Frost, and in the Rain, and yet I received no
Damage; nor was I affected with Slothfulness;
for then the Spirit of God was warm within
me.”</span> It was here he perfected himself in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Language, the wonderful Providence of
God visibly appearing in this Instance of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Captivity, that he should have the Opportunity
in his tender Years of becoming well acquainted
with the Language, Manners, and Dispositions
of that People, to whom he was intended as a
future Apostle. He continued six whole Years
in Servitude, and in the seventh was released.
There seems to have been a Law in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> for
this Purpose, agreeable to the Institution of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moses</span></span>, that a Servant should be released the
seventh Year.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having parted from his Master, after a great
Variety of Distresses, he at length arrived to his
Parents, who received him with extraordinary
Joy; with these he remained two Years, and
probably would much longer, had he not by a
Vision been quickened to a more active and glorious
Life. In this he thought he saw a Man
coming to him from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, whose Name was
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Victoricus</span></span>, with a great Number of Letters; that
he gave him one of them to read, in the Beginning
of which were contained these Words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vox-Hiberionacum</span></span>,
the Voice of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>: While
he was reading this Letter, he thought the same
Moment, that he heard the Voice of the Inhabitants
who lived near the Wood of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Foclut</span></span>, in
the Barony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tyr-Awley</span></span>, and County of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayo</span></span>, hard by the Western Sea, crying to him with an
audible and distinct Voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“We intreat thee,
holy Youth, to come and walk among us.”</span> He
was greatly amazed at this Vision, and awoke;
it animated him, however, to his future Studies
and heavenly Progress; so far even, that he
tells us himself, he thanked God, that after many
Years he had dealt with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, according to
their crying out.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Charity, Consideration, and Humility, to the
Rich, the Great, the Proud, and the Wanton;
who may recollect that, altho' he was well born,
he was nevertheless, in the most vigorous Season
of Life, a Slave and a Swine-Herd: Happy,
though wretched Servitude! In which, his leisure
Hours, mostly employed in Christian Confidence
and Prayer, made him so signally the
Favourite of Heaven, that from those cloudy
Dawnings, he in Process of Time became a
learned Doctor, a sanctified Missioner, a venerable
Prelate, an eminent Primate, a national Apostle,
and the bright Instructor of Kings! Such were
the fruitful Rewards of uninterrupted unshaken
Devotion, Piety, and Zeal! From this Time
he formed the steady Resolution of converting
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>; and, the better to accomplish the heavenly
Task, he undertook a laborious Journey
to foreign Countries, to enrich his Mind with
Learning and Experience.

his Name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magonius</span></span>, which was the third Name
he was known by,) partly among a Colony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermits</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monks</span></span>, in some Islands of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tuscan</span></span>
Sea; and he employed a good Part of the
Time in the City of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>, among the Canons
Regular of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lateran</span></span> Church: At length,
having his Soul thoroughly tempered with
religious Virtue, enlightened with the true
Evangelical Faith, and his Understanding enlarged
by the most profitable and edifying
Studies, he arrived in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> about the 60th
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Year of his Age; and in the Year of our Lord
432, landed in the County of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wicklow</span></span>, where
he began his Ministry, by the Conversion of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sinel</span></span>, a great Man in that Country, the Grandson
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Finchad</span></span>, who ought to be remembered,
as he was the first Fruits of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>'s Mission
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>; he was the 8th in lineal Descent from
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cormac</span></span>, King of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leinster</span></span>, and came
afterwards to be enumerated among the Saints of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this Country he sailed to an Island on
the Coast of the County of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dublin</span></span>, called after
him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inis Phadring</span></span>, and by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holm Patrick</span></span> at this Day, where he and his faithful
Companions rested after their Fatigues. From
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inis Phadring</span></span>, he sailed Northward to that Part
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ulster</span></span> called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ulidia</span></span>, and put in at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inbherslaying</span></span> Bay. When he and his Fellow Labourers
landed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dichu</span></span>, the Son of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trichem</span></span>, Lord
of the County, being informed that they were Pirates,
came out with armed Men in order to
kill them: But being struck with the venerable
Appearance of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>, he gave him Audience,
and listened attentively to the Word of
Life preached by him; he changed his wicked
Purpose, believed, and was baptized, and brought
over all his Family to the Faith: It is further
observed of him, that he was the first Person in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ulster</span></span>, who embraced Christianity. He dedicated
the Land whereon his Conversion was
wrought to the Service of God, where a Church
was erected, changed after to an eminent Monastery.
He travelled hence by Land to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clunebois</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dalaradia</span></span>, to endeavour the Conversion
of his old Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milcho</span></span>, whose Service he had
left thirty-eight Years before; but this obstinate
Prince, hearing of the great Success of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>'s
preaching, and ashamed to be persuaded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his old Age, to forsake the Religion of his
Ancestors, (by one especially who had been his
Servant, in a most inferior Station,) made a
funeral Pile of his House and Goods, and by
the Instigation of the Enemy of Mankind,
burned himself therein: Thus ended <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milcho McHuanan</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> returned to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inis</span></span>, the
Habitation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dichu</span></span>, and in his Journey converted
great Numbers to the true Faith of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></span>.
In some time, he took his Leave of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dichu</span></span>, and
bent his course Southward by Sea, keeping the
Coast on his Right-hand, and arrived at Port
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Colbdi</span></span>, where he landed, and committed the
Care of his Vessel to his Nephew <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luman</span></span>,
desiring him to wait for him there forty Days,
while he and his Disciples were travelling in the
inner Parts of the Country to preach the Gospel.
His Intention in this Journey was, to celebrate the Festival of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Easter</span></span> in the Plains of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bregia</span></span>, and
to be in the Neighbourhood of the Great Triennial
Convention at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarah</span></span>, which at this Season
was held by King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leogair</span></span>, and all his Tributary Princes,
Nobles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Druids</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annalists</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and Fileas</span></span>.
St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> wisely foreseeing that whatever Impressions
he should make on this august Assembly
must have an Influence on the whole Kingdom,
and therefore, being supported with invincible
Christian Fortitude, resolved not to be
absent from a Place where his Presence was so
conducive to the Ends of his Holy Ministry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Never did the Spirit of popular Freedom
exert itself more powerfully or harmoniously,
than in those truly parliamentary Triennial Conventions
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, where the supreme Monarch,
the Provincial Kings, the feudatory Lords,
the Nobles, landed Men, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Druids</span></span>, &amp;c. by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unbiased Suffrages of the People, convened for
the Peace, good Government and Security of
each particular Province, as well as those of the
whole Kingdom. Many Centuries had this
wise Constitution subsisted here, before our
Neighbours, even of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">South Britain</span></span>, knew any
thing relative to Houses, or Raiment; it being
notorious that so late as the Arrival of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius
Cæsar</span></span> among them, they painted their Bodies,
to render them terrible, and lived in the open
Fields. It is really somewhat surprzing that
People so near in Situation, should differ so
essentially in Disposition, as the Inhabitants of
those Islands have in all Ages; Hospitality having
been the distinguishing Attribute of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, and it's
opposite Defect, that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Britons</span></span>;
the Account given of them by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> 1700 and odd Years ago,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Visam Britannes Hospitibus feros</span></span>,
being as literally applicable to them at this Day,
where the Force of Education doth not operate
to mitigate their natural Ferocity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to return: St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> in his Way to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarah</span></span>, took up his Lodgings at the House of the
hospitable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sesgnen</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meath</span></span>, who kindly
received and welcomed him. St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> preach'd Christ
and his Gospel to him; he believed, and was
baptized with his whole Family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the House of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sesgnen</span></span>, he moved Westward,
and arrived on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Easter Eve</span></span> at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fierta-fir-feic</span></span>, on the Northern Banks of the River
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Boyne</span></span>, where he rested, resolving there to prepare for the next
Day's Solemnity. It was penal for any Person
at the Time of the Celebration of this solemn
Convention at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarah</span></span>, to kindle a Fire in the
Province, before the King's Bonfire first appeared.
I am of Opinion this was a religious Ceremony,
as the chief Deity of the ancient Inhabitants,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in exterior Worship especially, was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bel</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Belus</span></span>; whence <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apollo</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ap-haul</span></span>, the Son of the Sun, whom they emblematically worshipped,
by those fiery Offerings; whence the first Day of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May</span></span>, peculiarly dedicated to this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bel</span></span>,
is even now in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lha-Bel-Thinih</span></span>, and probably from the same Source may be
derived the Custom of lighting up Bonfires, and Sops, on the
Eve of the 24th Day of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span>. St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> however, either not knowing or not minding this
Ceremony, lighted up a Fire before his Booth,
which altho' eight Miles distant from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarah</span></span>,
was very visible. It was seen with Astonishment
from Court, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Druids</span></span> informed the King,
that if he did not immediately extinguish the
Fire, he who kindled it, and his Successors,
should for ever hold the Principality of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>;
which hath hitherto turned out a true Prediction
of those Heathen Priests, in a Primatial and
Spiritual Principality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The King dispatched Messengers to bring
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> before him, and gave his positive Orders,
that nobody should presume to rise out of his
Seat, or pay him the least Honour: But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ere</span></span>,
the Son of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dego</span></span>, ventured to disobey this Command;
he arose, and offered the Holy Father his
Seat. St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> preached to him and converted
him. He became a Person of eminent Sanctity,
and after some Time was consecrated by St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>, Bishop of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Slain</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Day following, when St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> and two
of his Disciples appeared unexpectedly at Court,
and preached to the King and his Nobles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dubtach</span></span>,
the King's Poet Laureat, payed Honour
and Respect to the Saint, and was converted
by his Preaching. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fiech</span></span>, a young Poet, who
was under the Tuition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dubtach</span></span>, was also converted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and afterwards made Bishop of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sletty</span></span>,
and is said to have been the Author of a celebrated
Poem, composed in Praise of St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anselm</span></span>, Arch-Bishop of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canterbury</span></span>,
relates the Conversion of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tingar</span></span>, the Son of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clito</span></span>, (one of the Nobles in this Assembly,) in the same Manner.
The Queen also, and many others of the
Court, became Christians; and altho' the King
held out for a long Time with great Obstinacy,
yet at last he submitted to be baptized. St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span>
is said here to have wrought many Miracles:
There could not truly, even according to
the Purposes of human Wisdom, have happened
a more solemn or weighty Occasion, for God
Almighty's supporting this Holy Preacher by
Miracles, than when the collective Body of the
whole Nation was assembled together; from
whose Report and Conviction, the Influences of
his blessed Works and Doctrine must of Course
spread through the whole Kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His Conduct and Proceedings here, with a
particular Detail of the Miracles wrought by
him, may be had at large in the History of his
Life, published by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Colgan</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarah</span></span>, the Saint proceeded next to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talten</span></span>, not far from thence, at the Season of the
Royal Diversions: Here he preached to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cairbre</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conall</span></span>, the two Brothers of King
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leogin</span></span>; the former received him with great Indignity,
and perversely shut his Ears against his Doctrine;
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conall</span></span> believed, and was baptized, and gave
St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patrick</span></span> a Place to build a Church on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conall</span></span> was Great-Grand-Father to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Columb-Kill</span></span>. He spent the Remainder of this Year
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meath</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Louth</span></span>, and the Districts
adjoining, preaching, and converting great Numbers
of People. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taltenian</span></span> Sports above-mentioned,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have been much celebrated by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>
Historians, and Antiquaries. They were a kind
of warlike Exercises, somewhat resembling the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympick</span></span> Games, consisting of Racing, Tilts,
Tournaments, Wrestling, Leaping, Vaulting,
and all other manly and martial Exercises,
which gave Rise to the many hyperbolical
Tales, formerly related of those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taltenian</span></span> Sports.
They were exhibited every Year at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talten</span></span>, a
Mountain in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meath</span></span>, for fifteen Days before,
and fifteen Days after the First of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">August</span></span>. Their
first Institution is ascribed to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lughaid-lam-fadha</span></span>,
the twelfth King of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, who began his
Reign <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A. M.</span></span> 2764 (a sufficient Proof of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>'s Antiquity as a Kingdom). They were
ordained by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lughaid</span></span>, in Gratitude to the Memory
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tailte</span></span>, the Daughter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magh-More</span></span>,
(a Prince of some Part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spain</span></span>) who having been married
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eochaid</span></span>, King of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, took the
same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lughaid</span></span> under her Protection, and had the Care
of his Education in his Minority. From this
Princess both the Sports, and the Place where
they were celebrated, took their Names: From <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lughaid</span></span>, the
First of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">August</span></span> was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lugnasa</span></span>,
or the Memory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lughaid</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nasa</span></span> signifying
Memory, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Language.

In the Year of the World 2700, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gideon</span></span> then

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
War against those Heroines, and defeated them,
more to the Glory of the Vanquished than their
own, those Matrons having defended themselves
with surprizing Resolution. They cut off the
Guards set over them, and escaped the Severity
and Pride of their Conquerors. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hercules</span></span>, in
Honour of such extraordinary heroick Females,
instituted the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympick</span></span> Games; as likewise did

Hostilities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hercules</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thesæus</span></span>,
sought Shelter in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spain</span></span>, whither they imported the

In this shining Period were Cathedrals and
Churches erected, Universities founded and
established, Colleges, Seminaries and Schools
propagated in many Parts of this Kingdom,
which, at the same Time, became a peaceful
and hospitable Retreat to religious and learned
Men, disturbed on the Continent of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Europe</span></span>, by
the frequent Invasions, and cruel Hostilities of
the North-men, whose Piracies and Barbarity,
even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> could not always escape! For,
from the Time of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Artigrius</span></span>, Archbishop of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ardmagh</span></span> in 822, for near 200 Years the cruel
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Danes</span></span> miserably ravaged this Kingdom, destroying,
by Fire and Sword, every Establishment,
as well of Piety as Learning, (to both which,
and to all religious Maxims of civilized Society,
they had been avowed implacable Enemies) till
they were themselves, in 1014, totally defeated
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clontarf</span></span>, by the invincible Arms of the Great
Monarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bryan Borou</span></span>, from whom descended
a Race conspicuous for exemplary Prelates, heroick
Leaders, and steady Patriots.

The learned Author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dissertations</span></span> before-mentioned,

supreme Monarchy was, by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugonian</span></span> Law,
inalienably united to one Family, whose Sovereignty,
however founded originally, whether
by Birth, or Election, was essential to the public

Necessities, but the Safety also of the People, at

those of the North and South <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hy-Nial</span></span>; from

Greatness, Concord, good Discipline, and
Happiness) had obliged, in the 8th Century,
so many learned Men to seek that Shelter and
Security on the Continent, which the barbarous
Hostilities, and impious Manners of those Northerns,
denied them at Home; had made such
frequent lamentable Breaches in the antient, wise
Constitution of the Kingdom; had, by the fatal
Example of their profligate dissolute Lives, so
vitiated the national Morality; and finally, had
left behind them so many noxious Seeds of Faction
and Anarchy, as, in less than two Centuries,
gave up a Kingdom, of above 2000 Years
Establishment, the unaccountable Prey of a
few adventurous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Normans</span></span>!

the Great and Royal Families of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, long

Some dramatick Scriblers, (probably of our

Why should even poor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teague</span></span> prove so constant

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teague</span></span> is

if a Gentleman should happen to miss his Road,
and be nessitated to seek the Shelter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teague</span></span>'s
Cabbin, or Hut, was poor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teague</span></span> trusting to
two Sheep for his worldly Subsistance, he would
kill one, and sell the other, at the next Village
or Inn, for the better Entertainment of his
Guest, and think himself happy in such an
Occasion of approving his Generosity and Respect:
He would the next Morning abandon his
Spade, and chearfully trot ten Miles to shew
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such bewilder'd Gentleman the right Road. He
is naturally civil, generous, and hospitable, (for
scarce a Night passeth that poor Travellers are
not entertained in his Cottage,) extremely respectful
to his Superiors, and to his Lord and
Master faithful to Death. The military Annals
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Europe</span></span> proclaim his Capacity and Taste for
Fighting; then if you should take this identical
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teague</span></span>'s infant Son, and give him a regular
liberal Education, it is one hundred to one,
but he turns out a Gentleman of Merit, Learning,
Worth, and Politeness; whereas it would
certainly require more than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herculean</span></span>
Labour to chissel a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French Paisan</span></span>, a primitive

This <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Donat</span></span>, Bishop of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fesula</span></span>, was an

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">O Hogan</span></span>; a Family which held ample and
fair Possessions in the Province of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Munster</span></span>, and
which, in former Times, adorned the See of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Killaloe</span></span>, with four very learned and exemplary
Prelates; namely, with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matthew O Hogan</span></span>, who
succeeded to this Bishoprick, in the Reign of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the IIId, and in the Year of our Lord
1267; and who, having much enlarged his Diocese,
and done many signal Acts of popular Charity,
died in the Year, 1281, and was buried
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Limerick</span></span>, in a Convent of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dominican</span></span>

who governed this See with peculiar Zeal and
Charity, upwards of sixteen Years, and died in
1298, or the Year following, and was buried
in his own Church. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas O Hogan</span></span>, Canon

near four Centuries, from its original Date and

Protection, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agreed</span></em> for quiet, regular,
and lawful Government, upon rationable Terms,
deprived of the Power of ordaining Laws for
its own Security and Well-being, and precluded
(all to four or five great and favourite Families)
from the Benefits and Advantages accruing from
those of that Kingdom, to which it had voluntarily
united itself; exposed, through such a
Length of Time, to arbitary Depredations, and
unpunished, unredressed, uncensured Rapine,

more to screen him from the implacable

of this Country; who, indiscriminately,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Strongbownians</span></span> as well as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>)
felt the Severity of that insolent Favourite's Measures.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span> the Second visited this Kingdom in
Person, with the good Intentions of establishing
Peace, Order, and Harmony, in a valuable but
long neglected Estate: Yet his own adverse
Fate, conspiring with that of this Land, called
him back, before he could carry his favourable
Resolutions into Execution, to defend his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>
Dominions from the hostile Attacks of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span>,
Earl of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hereford</span></span>, who, with the Duke of

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gaunt</span></span>, had some Years before
been banished by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span>, to prevent a
personal Combat: This King, worthy more
propitious Stars, long agitated and afflicted by
the Turbulence and irreconcilable Obstinacy of
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">British</span></span> Subjects, perished at last under the
impious Hands of Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pierce</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exton</span></span>,
who, at the Head of eight barbarous armed Assassins,
rushed into his Chamber, and murdered him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Reign of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Fourth was short,
tumultuous, and bloody; Deluges of noble Blood
having been shed by the bare Hands of the
common Executioner, to confirm a Throne acquired
by abominable Crimes, and Violence!
And no sooner had these dreadful Storms begun
to abate, than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> was forced to depart from
a Scene he had more adorned, (for he was,
without Question, a great and valiant Man)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had not his Ambition blindly hurried him beyond
the Bounds of Justice and Nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Fifth, his Son and Successor, and
truly Inheritor of his Ambition and warlike
Genius, imagining himself aggrieved by the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salique Law</span></span>, which excluded his Great Great-Grandmother,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isabel</span></span>, from the Monarchy of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>, turned his elevated Thoughts intirely
to the Conquest of that Kingdom: Wherein,
by his own vast Merit in martial Affairs, and
the Co-operation of the Queen of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>, (Consort
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charles</span></span> the Sixth, then frantick,) and that
of the Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Burgundy</span></span>, a great and powerful
Prince, he so far succeeded, as, after his Marriage
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catharine de Valois</span></span>, Daughter of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charles</span></span> the Sixth, to be crowned, and acknowledged
King of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this great and victorious Monarch succeeded
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Sixth, who, through a long,
various, and constantly clouded Reign, seemed
the very Play of Fortune! This Day a King,
the next a Prisoner! One Day acknowleged by
his Parliament, the next attainted! One Day a
Conqueror, and the next a Captive!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fierce, frequent, and bloody, were the Conflicts
between the Houses of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">York</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">White</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Red Roses</span></span>; the former
endeavouring to recover its Loss, the latter to maintain
its usurped Authority. In this dreadful Quarrel
perished two hundred thousand of private Soldiers;
ten thousand of the Nobility, Gentry,
and Persons of Distinction; three Kings; and,
at last, the entire Race of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plantagenet</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edward</span></span> the Fourth soon fell, by his natural
Intemperance, or rather by the insatiable Cruelty
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>; who had already sacrificed his
Brother <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clarence</span></span>, to pave his Way to the Throne.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Nor better fared it with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edward</span></span> the Fifth, who,
by all the Arts of Seduction and Delusion,
which his unnatural Uncle and Guardian,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span>, practised on the Fears and Weakness
of the Queen Dowager; was, with his Brother
the Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">York</span></span>, conveyed with great Pomp
to the Tower; where the bloody Tyrant, aided
by the Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buckingham</span></span>, soon sacrificed
those young, innocent and hopeful Princes to
his wicked and boundless Ambition. But he
soon after lost his own flagitious Life, and a
most cruelly-acquired Crown, on the Plains of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bosworth</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To him succeeded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Seventh, and the
first of the Race of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tudor</span></span>, a great, wise and
valiant Prince, but rather too much inclined to
Rigour, and Avarice; Imperfections which extremely
blemished his other great Qualities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the tenth Year of this Reign, the Parliamentary
Constitution of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> received a
deeper Stab than had ever before, or since, been
inflicted thereon, by a Statute Law, commonly
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poynin</span></span>'s Act; by which a new, and, till
that wretched Period, an unheard of Order, was
added to the three established Ranks of the
State. By this Law, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Privy-Council
may impose a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Negative</span></span> on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unanimous</span></em> Parliamentary Ordinances of the representative
Body of the Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>; a manifest
Injury to the Authority and Dignity of Parliament;
and an equal Diminution of the Royal
Prerogative, that only should include, and
should alone exert, a Power so important.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Times dark, tumultuated and dangerous,
no Wonder extraordinary Laws should pass:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Desperate Diseases</span></span> require <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">desperate
Remedies</span></span>: But when the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fever</span></span> is removed, it certainly is a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
horrid Management to leave the blistering
Plaister <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still sticking</span></em> to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recovered</span></em> Patient's
Back.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Distempers of this Nation were heavy,
complicated and chronic; and finally curable,
only by the salutary all-healing Hands of our
present King, and present Parliament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Seventh succeeded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the
Eighth, as consummate a Tyrant, in every
Sense, as ever swayed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">British</span></span>, or any other
Sceptre; whose whole Life was so continued a
Scene of wanton Dissipation, Lust, Cruelty,
Rapine, Bloodshed and Sacrilege, that it must
have been a peculiar Happiness, to any Part of
his Dominions, to have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neglected</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forgotten</span></em>
by him: Nor could the two succeeding
Reigns of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edward</span></span> the Sixth, and Queen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mary</span></span>,
short, various, cloudy, and vastly agitated on
the Score of Religion, (which, in those two
Reigns, took Faces almost diametrically opposite,)
afford this Kingdom much reflected
Sunshine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To those ensued that of Queen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elizabeth</span></span>, a
Princess of powerful Abilities, who, truly intent
on the Peace and Welfare of her Subjects,
caused her Laws to operate, and Justice to circulate
in this Kingdom, abandoned, as hath
been observed, to a State almost of Anarchy,
thro' a dismal Series of seventeen Reigns: But
the Reformation in Religion, which she established
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and introduced in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>,
much obviated her Purposes for the latter Kingdom:
For, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, more tenacious of their
Altars, than of their Fire-places, could not
easily reconcile themselves to the Exchange of a
Religion they deemed a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new one</span></em>, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> they
had been in Possession of from the fourth, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the fifteenth Century: Which produced a rebellious
Defection, in a few of the principal
Chieftains of this Land, and gave Occasion to
the greedy Provincial Precedents, of trumping
up <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imaginary Rebellions</span></em>, to pave the Way to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
Forfeitures</span></em>; thereby to aggrandize their own
Houses; what some of them effectually accomplished,
to the Ruin and Extirpation of
many honest Families.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This great and illustrious Princess, (whose
Reign had remained untarnished, had it not
been for the Death of the ill-fated Queen of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>) was succeeded by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span> the
Sixth of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, and the first of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stuart</span></span> Race that governed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>: From
this Prince, descended of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Kings, the People of

The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charles</span></span>, regardless of this important

the Land, had pirated the national Stock, would
cause much Confusion. As for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">former</span></em>, he
hoped some Settlement might in Time be found
for them; (in Truth, I believe, for aught his
Majesty in Reality concerned himself, this might
have been in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terra Australis Incognita</span></span>). Their
Want of Stock is the less to be admired at, it
being well known, that, with their Pay in foreign
Service, chiefly expended to contribute all
in their Power to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal Support</span></span>, they even
went so far as to sell their Plate, and valuable
Moveables, to answer the same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generous Purpose</span></em>:
But, when every known Acre in the Kingdom,
that could be disposed of, was given away
by Wholesale to the Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">York</span></span>, the Heir-apparent
of the Crown, (partial Distribution!)
to new-fangled Favourites, and the staunch old
Enemies of Church and Crown; it was hoped
some Lands might be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yet</span></em> discovered, to satisfy
and compensate those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Worthies, who had
Nothing left for their Support, beside an inalienable
Sense of Honour and Loyalty, and a Character
of invincible Fidelity (which all Nations
admired and applauded). No such Discovery,
however, was made, nor any relative to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span>, under that Administration, but what
tended to convince them, by the famous Act
of Settlement, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">&amp;c.</span></span> of the extraordinary severe
Peculiarity of their Fate! Yet, ordained to
shew Posterity unprecedented Specimens of Loyalty
and Zeal, they still adhered, with inflexible
Constancy, to the Fortunes of King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span> the

Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Barry</span></span>'s Capacity, as a Manager, appeareth
equal to his eminently-affecting Powers
in Tragedy, (so generally known, and so unexceptionably
confessed) from the magnificent
Theatre, erected by that Gentleman, with amazing
Expedition, in Grandeur, Convenience,
and Elegance, preferable to any in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paris</span></span>: From the obliging Decency the respective

evidently from the surpassing theatrical Abilities
of the Company, that, with the most engaging
Variety, entertains the Publick in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Crow-street</span></span>
Play-house. I have sometimes seen, and have

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quinault</span></span>; and, if I
may take Leave to declare my Opinion, am
therein clear that Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Barry</span></span>, in the exquisitely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pathetick Strokes of deep Tragedy, touches the
Soul with as much delicate Sensibility, and, in
the irrefrainable Sallies of the more boisterous
Passions, soars with as majestick Wings, as any
one of them, I will not say higher. To behold
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Barry</span></span>, sublimely struggling in a Storm of
Adversity, with the sudden Shocks, and unexpected
Blows of Fortune; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>, (when all human
Efforts must yield to inevitable Necessity)
sinking in the irretrievable Plunge of Sorrow
and Calamities, with that calm Resignation ever
attendant on true Heroism; must convince any
judicious Spectator of his being born a Tragedian.
I must here declare, that what I have
advanced on this Subject neither ariseth from
Prepossession on one Side, or Prejudice on the
other; having no Manner of Connection, nay,
not even a personal Acquaintance, with Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Barry</span></span>; nor any Objection to Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sheridan</span></span>,
but such as must naturally issue from my just Resentment
against any Individual, of whatsoever
Rank, Character, or Denomination, who should
prove so ignorant, and yet so hardy, as to declare
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elocution lost</span></span> in our native Country; an illiberal
Censure, which, if true, had necessarily wrapped
our High Court of Parliament, the whole Body
of our Clergy, our University, Bench and Bar,
in Shades that, I am certain, had been never
dispell'd by the Approach of Light, so dim and
glimmering as that Gentleman's.

Let us now take a summary View of the Inhabitants
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, in their respective Ranks:
And to begin with the Peers: Are they not such
Personages, as, by their Munificence, Affability
of Manners, Easiness of Comportment,
Propriety of Appearance, and Generosity in
dealing, reflect true Honour on Nobility; and,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Reality, derive their superior Rank, as much
from the Pre-eminence of their Virtues, as from
the constitutional Dignity of their Titles?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Encrease of our People, Wealth, Commerce,
Industry, Arts, Inventions; the extraordinary
additional Number, in this happy
Reign, of our beautiful Seats, elegant Improvements,
useful and ornamental Plantations, extensive
Inclosures, excellent high Roads, (formerly
almost impassable,) with the visible Reformation
in national Harmony, and Allegiance,
will best suggest an Idea of the Honourable the
House of Commons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, composed of
such candid Spirits, as, neither the Smiles or
Frowns of superior Influence, popular Views,
or private Connections, can bend from the various
essential Duties due to their King, their
Country, and themselves; constant in their
Attendance; careful in their Protection; and
zealous in their Promotion of publick Felicity;
not more extensive in their noble Projects, for
this great Purpose, than expeditious in carrying
those into Execution.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our Constitution, partly of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gothic</span></span>, partly of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Norman</span></span> Institution, (the first High Court of

been ordained in the Reign of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the First,
Son of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William</span></span> the Conquerer) avoiding the
turbulent Licentiousness of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Democracy</span></span>, the
factious domineering Temper of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristocracy</span></span>, and
the variable oppressive Sway of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arbitrary Monarchy</span></span>;
but including, by an harmonious Assemblage,
the essential Virtues of those different
Systems of Government; is unquestionably the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best digested</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wisest</span></em> in the known World:
Under which, the King and the Nobles, with

preserve the Lives, defend the Characters, support
the Liberties, and protect the Property of
the People. Bless'd Constitution! O! may it
ever flourish! under whose mild and preservative
Influence, a few only feel Restraint; except
from the Commission of private Evil, or
social Injury.

I have said a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Few only</span></em>; because there are some
among us, who, on the Score of Religion, are
secluded from permanent Property: And even
Those, it is hoped, will, in Consideration of the
invariable Tenor of their humble and pacific
Conduct, from the Capitulation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Limerick</span></span>, to

Obedience to our Civil Government, e're

Pamphlets, wherein these Gentlemen's
political Principles are fully and clearly explained,
shew of what signal Advantage it had been
to the Numbers, Industry, Health, Wealth,
and Beauty of this Kingdom, to indulge them
a Property, even in our uncultivated Mountains,
dreary Wastes, and noxious Marshes:
Which Measure, should it appear in a true Light
to our worthy Representatives, we may in a
few Years more, hope to see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> one of the
most beautiful, best-improved, best-conditioned
Islands in the Universe. Our Bench is adorned
with Honourable Personages, conspicuous for
Learning, Integrity, Humanity, and Impartiality;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of whom, it may be boldly affirmed,
and with the strictest Truth, that they are not
Favourers of Persons. The present Lord Chief
Justice of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King-Bench</span></span>, the late Master of
the Rolls, and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Natives of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, formed a Triumvirate, whose
Learning, Worth, and distinguished Abilities,
had rendered them eminently respectable in the
brightest Æras, either of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Commonwealth,
or Empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our Attorney and Solicitor General, our Serjeants
at Law, and King's Council, with many
eminent Barristers, and a Set of learned eloquent
young Gentlemen, all shining out together;
such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tully</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hortensius</span></span>, and

In the Diocese of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dublin</span></span> existeth a truly
pious Society for the Relief and Support of the
Widows and Children of the inferior Clergy
thereof. It is, indeed, surprizing in a Kingdom,
such (thank Heaven) as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> is, that
the Example of this charitable Society, hath
not been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universally</span></em> followed. It hath often
affected me to the Quick, to have seen a learned
Divine, after a tedious and painful Free-School
Institution, and expensive University Education,
struggling, upon a poor Pension or Salary of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Forty</span></em> Pounds a Year, to maintain an honest
Gentlewoman, Children, and Servants, (and
really with some Decency of Hospitality) sedulously
discharging, at the same Time, the different
Duties of the pastoral Function; when a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign Fidler</span></em> shall run away with tripple that
Sum, or more, for one Night's Performance.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I would by no Means be understood to derogate
from the Merits of fine Performers in the different
Parts of Musick, or endeavour to diminish
their reasonable Perquisites: But, surely,
such Men and such Things are not to be thought
of, in Competition with those, who, by Teaching
and Preaching, refine our Morals, instruct
our Understandings, inform our Lives, and enlighten
our Souls with the celestial Spirit of the
Christian Faith; and thereby happily lead us,
through this transient and precarious State, to
eternal Tranquilly and Bliss. I am not a
Preacher; but thus far shall venture: As the
Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom,
our generally following the heavenly Example
of this venerable Society, must be a great Test
as well of the one, as the other. If the Bishops,
the temporal Lords, and great estated Men of
each Diocese, would but graciously lead the
Way, it is not unlikely they had been attended
by Crowds of zealous Followers: And, in Fact,
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">small</span></em> Matter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annually set apart</span></em>, from even the
superfluous Outgoings of the Wealthy and
Opulent, of different Ranks, would very happily
answer the generous noble End of preserving,
from an anxious State of particular Dependance,
Numbers of virtuous, well-educated
Gentlewomen, and their Children, from the various
Miseries, which the untimely Death of a
Father, and narrow Circumstances, but too frequently
expose them to; an End so every Way
worthy the natural Disposition, the benevolent
Temper, the inherent Hospitality, and the essentially-charitable
Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Protestant</span></span> Brethren, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dissenters</span></span>,

Pound a Year, each parochial Minister, for this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
religiously humane Purpose, have constantly a
Fund sufficient to allow the Relict of each
Clergyman twenty Pounds a Year, (which preserves
her from the Miseries of Want and Dependance)
and have, at some Periods, where-with
to set their Children up, in an honest and
creditable Way of living. As we are emulously
fond of adopting the Wisdom and Virtues of
each Christian Sect and Society, it is fervently
hoped we will also this tender and pious Scheme;
a Scheme so comprehensive of true Charity, and
so productive of social and happy Effects! How
difficult is it for Minds, crowded with Cares,
and beset with the pressing Calls of Family-preservation,
to attend, with due Composure and
Inclination, to the various indispensible Duties
of the pastoral Office? But how chearfully would
those Reverend Gentlemen proceed in their
divine Mission, when, by some visible Provision
for the proper Objects of their present Cares and
future Concern, they should, in a great Measure,
be released from domestick Anxiety, from
gloomy Apprehensions, and alarming Prospects,
into the temporal Futurity of those, for whom
they must be necessarily affected with the most
tender Feelings!

The most convincing and decisive Method of
adjudging Causes, being by a comprehensive
View and critical Examination of their Effects;
of Streams, by a nice Scrutiny and Investigation
of their Sources; hence may we, from the
shining Characters, and extensive Abilities of
our Divines and Barristers, frame a just Idea of
the University of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dublin</span></span>, which, for Compass
and Extent of the Sciences, Variety of elegant
Arts, found Erudition, and polite Literature
therein taught, in the most regular and perspicuous

The Students are carefully instructed in the
more refined Parts of classical Learning; oriental,
antient, and modern Languages; Criticism,
sacred and profane History, Oratory, Logick,
Ethicks, and Metaphysicks; in natural and experimental
Philosophy; Anatomy, Botany and
Chymistry; the mathematicks, in Theory and
Practice; Civil and Canon Laws; Theology,
Controversy, and Ecclesiastical History: So
that, with a good Capacity, and regular Application,
one may depart this University, as
completely and happily instituted for the honorary
Professions of Life, as may be reasonably
expected from any Nursery of Learning extant.
The obtaining a Fellowship in this University,
is a demonstrative Test of comprehensive native
Talents, thorough intellectual Cultivation,
deep and various learned Acquirements.

Which, for Extent, Convenience, Magnificence,

exceeds any one College in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Europe</span></span>. The beautiful

a few Cheeses, Salmon and Kelp: But, as our
Linens are, without Question, become the vital
Spring of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Commerce, it is Matter of great
Concern and equal Surprize, that the other Provinces
do not more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universally</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effectually</span></em> follow

Over-growth of Graziers and Stockmasters, is
the strongest Indication that can be of national
Waste and Decay, in respect of Inhabitants.
What could a Foreigner, travelling among us,
particularly in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">western</span></em> Counties, some Summers
past, judge of our national Wisdom and
Oeconomy? Would he not start even at our
Humanity, on seeing the best arable Grounds
in the Kingdom, in immense Tracts, wantonly
enjoyed by the Cattle of a few petulant Individuals;
and at the same Juncture, our high
Ways and Streets crowded with Shoals of mendicant
fellow-creatures! reduced, through Want
of proper Sustenance, to the utmost Distress?

It must afford real Satisfaction to consider the

Reigns: And, without Question, this Reformation
must still rise higher, in Proportion to the
Lenity of our worthy Legislature, and wise Indulgence

find it more conducive to the Welfare of the

improving Families, than wasted by a few Purse-proud
Bullock-Brokers, who rarely allow the

Suppose a Gentleman was to let two thousand
Acres of arable Ground to farm; were it not
demonstrably more conducive to all the foregoing
Motives, to dispose of these to twenty honest,
industrious Families, at an hundred Acres each,
than to any one Beau-Grazier whatever? From
the twenty Tenures, the Landlord may, in any
national Shock, raise a considerable Number of
effective Hands, and zealous Hearts, for the
Service of the Crown, or Defence of his Country;
and reap many signal Advantages to the
public and private Concernments of Life, not
possibly derivable from the anti-social Monopolizers
and Forestallers of Farms; who ever fondly
attribute their Growth to their own Sagacity
and Cleverness, without any the least Gratitude
or Obligation to the Land-owner. These Sentiments,
it is hoped, will every Day gain more
and more Consideration with our wise and beneficent
Legislature, Nobility and Gentry.

Cunning, Craft, or Dissimulation, these are such

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I think myself indebted to any Occasion
that restores you to a Friend,
whom I feared you had long forgotten.
But I confess, at the same
Time, that the Pleasure of hearing
from you, after a Silence of Several Years, is,
in some Measure, damped by the Censure that
seems to constitute the chief Intent of your
Letter.

You tell me that you lately happened upon
some Papers that were entitled The FARMER's
LETTERS, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">&amp;c.</span></span> which were imputed to me
as the Author. And, after some Compliments
on Spirit, and Genius, and so forth, in order to
palliate, as I suppose, what you purpose to administer,
you charge me, by Implication, with
Crimes, whose smallest Tendency I should abhor
in myself, as in any Man breathing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You say, favourably enough for your own
Disposition, that you have long looked on the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman-Catholics</span></span> of these Kingdoms as a discountenanced
and pitiable People. That you
would choose to allow to others the same Latitude
of Conscience that you like for yourself.
That it is not a Part of Humanity to break a
Reed already bruised. That such a Treatment
would be blameable respecting any Individual;
how much more so, in Prejudice of a whole
People. That those Papers are pointed with a
Keenness of Enmity, for which the Talents,
which you are pleased to ascribe, cannot sufficiently
apologize. And, that you did not think
me capable of exasperating Government and
Power against a Set of Men who were already
under the Displeasure and Depression of the
Law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These, my dear Friend, are home and heavy
Accusations, however tempered by Expressions
of Kindness and Affection from the Man whom
I sincerely love and respect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, if I know any-thing of myself, the Quality,
called Ill-nature, is not my Characteristic.
I would not exchange one Grain of Good-heart
for all the Wit of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C----d</span></span> or Comprehension
of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">P--tt</span></span>, independent of their Virtue.
And I may say, with great Truth, that an Excess
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Humanity hath occasioned all the Misfortunes
and Distresses of my Life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I most solemnly assure you, that when I wrote
those Letters I was in perfect Love and Charity
with every <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman Catholic</span></span> in the Kingdom of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>. I knew that they were a depressed People.
I had long pitied them as such. I was
sensible that the Laws, under which they suffered,
had been enacted by our Ancestors, when
the Impressions of Hostility were fresh and
warm, and when Passion, if I may venture to
say so, co-operated, in some Measure, with
Utility and Reason. I will go a Step further.
I thought those Laws not severe enough to suppress
them as Enemies, nor yet sufficiently favourable
to attach them to us as Friends. They
were not so cruel as, wholly, to serve for quelling;
and yet they had a Poignancy that might
tend to provoke. And all this I imputed to the
Resentment that was blended with the Humanity
of our Ancestors. Their Humanity left to Papists
a Power of hurting, while their Resentment
abridged the Inducements that might engage
them to serve us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Believe me, Sir, I never was of a cruel or
persecuting Disposition. I was grieved to see
the Discouragements under which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman
Catholics</span></span> of this Kingdom laboured, but these
very Discouragements made me fear them the
more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Previous to the Letters, which you censure so
warmly, a dangerous Rebellion had broken out
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, in consequence of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span>
Invasion, that was headed by a Popish Pretender to the
Throne. Be pleased to remember, (if it is not
too mortifying a Recollection for a free-born
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Briton</span></span>) the Pannic into which all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
struck by a few <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotch</span></span> Vassals, undisciplined, and
unactuated by any Motive of Liberty or Virtue,
save the Virtue of being attached to their
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Laird</span></span> or their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leader</span></span>. Millions of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>, at
that Time, sunk in the Down of a long Peace,
and enervated by ministerial Corruption and Venality,
feared that a Handful of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Highlanders</span></span>
would win their Way to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, and, at one
Stroke, put a Period to the boasted Strength and
Grandeur of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">British</span></span> Constitution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was astonished at the Apprehensions that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> was under from so contemptible an Armament.
But I deemed the Case of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> to
be highly alarming. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman-Catholics</span></span>, at
that Time, outnumbered us Five to One. They
were disarmed, it is true, but I was not equally
sure that they had Reason to be reconciled. As
they were not admitted to realize their Fortune,
it consisted of ready Money, and that gave
ready Power. As they were not permitted to
purchase, or accept a Tenure of any valuable
Length, Loyalty, perhaps, might induce them
to fight for their King; but where was the Stake
to impel them to fight for a Country in which
they had no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inheritance</span></span>? Without an Interest
in Lands, they had little to lose by any Change
of Estate. Without a Loan lodged with Government,
they had the less to lose by a Change of
Constitution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot conceive how <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Religion</span></span>, or mere Difference
of Opinion, should prove a real Cause
of Quarrel among Men; though it often serves
as a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Word of War</span></span>, or a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Term</span></span> whereby to give
Notice for Onset. On the contrary, I had observed
that wherever People are united by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interest</span></span>,
though of a thousand opposite Sects, Persuasions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Professions, they never fail to join
in the Maintenance and Defence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common
Rights</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I, therefore, did not fear the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman Catholics</span></span>,
as having a different <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Religion</span></span>, but as having
an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interest</span></span> that was different from the Interest
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Protestants</span></span>. Were they a Compound of all
the Follies, Absurdities, and Contradictions that
ever were generated by Monster-bearing Superstition,
had their Interest bound them to us, I
should not have feared their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fealty</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this was not the Case. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span> Invasion
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great Britain</span></span> was headed by a Person
who was, by Birth, Education, Principle, and
Interest, an Enemy to the Freedom and Rights
of a Constitution that was established on the Dispossession
of his Ancestors; and he was, consequently,
an Enemy to the general Change of
Privilege and Property, that ensued on the said
Establishment. The said Change, as we all
know, was to the Disadvantage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman Catholics</span></span>.
Had the Invader prevailed, a Change
would again have ensued, in their Favour.
Men naturally with Success to an Event from
whence they propose Benefit; and it is as natural
for them to act conformable to those Wishes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman Catholics</span></span> been possessed of an unrestrained
Property, along with the other Liberties,
Blessings, and Enjoyments, which they
derived, in common with us, from the Establishment
at the Revolution, no spiritual or
temporal Power on Earth could have tempted
them to permit, much less to wish, a Change
of a Constitution whose Equal they could not
find upon Earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as this was very far from being the Fact,
I feared that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interest</span></span> might prove an Incentive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Desire</span></em>; and Desire equally prove an Incentive
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Action</span></em>; and, I am not ashamed to confess,
that my Expectations were greatly, though happily,
disappointed, by the Steadiness of their
peaceful and loyal Demeanour on that trying
Occasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Believe me, my Friend, at the Time that I
wrote those Papers, which have given you so
much Offence, I looked upon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papists</span></span> of this
Kingdom, by the Patronage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spain</span></span>, by their Numbers, by their Wealth, and by
their Union with each other, to be vastly superior
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish Protestants</span></span>, in Power; and my Spirit
of Opposition rose, in Proportion to my Idea
of their Ability. But neither then, before, nor
since, did I ever mean to excite any Action, or
Intention, against the Weak, or the Oppressed,
the Fallen, or the Afflicted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span> unsheathed the reluctant Sword
of Freedom against his Friend, Humanity must
suppose that his Heart was wrung with Compunction,
while his Country enjoined and impelled
the Blow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But further, Sir, there is a very wide Difference
between a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popish Regency</span></span> and a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popish
People</span></span>. The whole Intent and Virulence, as
you call it, of my Papers, is pointed and levelled
against the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em>, but not a Syllable uttered,
from End to End, against the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Other</span></em>. A <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popish
Regency</span></span>, in Temporals alike as in Spirituals, I
held to be, by Principle, an arbitrary and oppressive
Government; but I held a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popish People</span></span>
to be, of all People, the most amenable and
submissive to Rulers, whatever the Form or
Nature of that State may be, under which they
shall happen to be subjected. And, on this
very Account, I dreaded them the more, should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they become passive Instruments in the Hand of
a Papal Dictator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To apply a sure Test to the Propriety, or Impropriety,
of my Apprehensions, at the Period
when I wrote the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Farmer's Letters</span></span>, let us suppose
that no one of the Penal Laws, which
were instituted during the Reign of her Majesty
Queen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anne</span></span>, had yet passed into Form,
but that Matters had remained in the same Situation,
in which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monarch</span></span>, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humane</span></span>, as well
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">glorious Memory</span></span>, had left this unhappy People.
Well, what would have been the Consequence?
Would <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papists</span></span>, in that Case, have
been less amenable to the Government, by
which they had been favoured, supported, and
cherished? Would they have been the forwarder
to bring Damage and Destruction on a Country,
because their own Interest was connected
therewith, and the Fortunes of their Posterity
deposited therein? Would they have been the
readier to attempt the Overthrow of our beneficent
Constitution, because they enjoyed the Privileges
and Advantages thereof? No, Sir, no.
The Absurdity of the Supposition is inclusive of
the Answer. Had this been the Case, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Farmer's
Letters</span></span> would not have existed to have
caused the Renewal of our Acquaintance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have read and noted many Instances, in free
States and Commonwealths, where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberty</span></span>, when
fermented into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Licentiousness</span></span>, hath occasioned
many partial Struggles for Power, many Broils
and Factions, and much Disturbance to the
Community. But very few are the Instances of
the Insurrection of any People, who have not
been goaded thereto by Severity and Oppression.
The inoffensive Stag grows formidable when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I forget the Book, though I remember the
Passage, where a Prince demanded of his favourite
Minister, what he should do with a
Number of the Commons and Nobility, whom
he had suppressed and taken Captive in the Act
of Rebellion? The Minister answered, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Put
them, and their Adherents, instantly to Death</span></span>. No,
replied the Prince, that were an Act of such
Bloodshed and Barbarity, as neither Fear nor
Revenge shall persuade me to perpetrate. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Then,
grant them all free Pardon</span></span>, rejoined the Minister.
How! said the Prince, must Rebellion
go altogether unpunished? There is no Medium
that can assure your Safety, answered the
Minister; you must either pull this Party wholly
up by the Root, so as to leave no Fibre from
whence future Enmity may grow; or else, you
must change that Enmity into Friendship, by
binding their Gratitude to your Person and Interest,
with the kindliest of all Connections,
that of your Goodness and Favour. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A partial
Punishment will be too little for your Safety; a partial
Pardon will not be enough.</span></span> You must either
wholly annihilate their Power, by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Death</span></span>;
or derive Strength to yourself, from that Power,
by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Friendship</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By disarming our Enemies, the utmost we
can hope, is, to render them impotent. The
Diminution of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> Power adds nothing to our
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">own</span></em>. Repentance is never so permanent or sincere,
as when preceded by Pardon; and Favour
is, as the polar Attraction, to Inclination. Is
there a Man whose Love and Gratitude you
desire to engage? Common Sense will direct
you to do him a Benefit. Would you bind him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to your Service with Hoops of Steel? You
must make it his Interest, as well as his Duty,
to befriend you.

up within his little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></span> Demesne. If some few
still acknowledge to hold of his Authority, it
is a Homage of Words, and not of Facts;
they will not acknowledge to hold of his Power.

Matters are much altered with the ecclesiastical
World, even since I wrote the Letters that
have roused your Spleen. Whether it be through
a Decline of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romish</span></span> Religion, in particular;
or, possibly, through a Decline of all Religion,
in general; the pontifical and episcopal Dictatorship
and Authority are wofully fallen, from the
Chair of Infallibility, where they had been seated
by Opinion. The Sons of the most bigotted
Ancestors do now perceive, that Piety and Immorality
are not rightly consistent. And even
the vulgar and ignorant, among the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Laity,
would grumble at departing from an Inch
of their Property, though the Priest should
advise, and the Pope, himself, should enjoin
it.

of the Life of Man, since these People have offended
in Word or in Deed. No Riotings have
been heard in their Houses, no Complainings

as Sheep before their Sheerers. Our Parties,
Factions, and Insurrections, as they are merrily
stiled in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, have been all among ourselves;
this People were neither Actors nor
Partakers therein. They have offered themselves
to our Fleets, and to our Armies; to tend our
Persons, to till our Grounds, to hew our Wood,
and to draw our Water. Where we admit them
to fight for us, they have ever proved valiant;
where we admit them to serve us, they are found
loving, observant, and faithful. Temptations
have come to their Doors and called them forth;
the Contagion of Rebellion hath broken out
among their Neighbours; they have yet remained
quiet, and continued untainted; still
loyal to their Sovereign, amenable to Government,
and submissive to Law, through a long
and trying Succession of about seventy Years,
they have scarce appeared to repine in the midst
of their Calamities.

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
